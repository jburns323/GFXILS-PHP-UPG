  <div id="authenticate">
    <h4>How do I login?</h4>
    <p>
      You can log in with your own user name and Password. Use just the IDSID as in example below.
      (User=IDSID and not amr\IDSID). 
      If you are denied access to the site itself, contact your system administrator to give you access 
      to the site. Currently all GFX SV users (Folsom and Columbia) should have access. If you
      are having trouble logging in, contact your system administrator by email.

  <div id="Entry_delete">
    <h4>How do I delete/alter a booking?</h4>
    <p>
      Double click on the booking and click 'delete entry' to delete a booking or 
      click 'edit entry' to modify a booking. In order to delete or alter a booking, 
      you must be logged in as the same person that made the meeting.
      Contact one of the meeting room administrators or the person who initially made the meeting to
      have it deleted or changed.

  <div id="multiple_users">
    <h4>What happens if multiple people schedule the same system?</h4>
    <p>
      The short answer is: The first person to click on
      the <dfn>Submit</dfn> button wins.
      Also the system will not allow you to book on top of another booking.

    <a></a><h4>How do I get Information about each system or system config?</h4>
    <p>
      On the top header bar of the website, you will see a 'Systems' menu next to where you found this 'help'. 
      Click on Systems and choose the spcific area and click on the specific system to get all the config information
      about that particular system. Currently we have the Host names and as much information possible in 'Description' 
      field. For execution systems on the rack, you will find KVM and IP information by just choosing that particular 
      execution area.
